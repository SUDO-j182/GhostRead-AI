# üëª GhostRead-AI

**GhostRead-AI** is a brutally honest, GPT-powered web tool that scans pasted conversations ‚Äî like text messages with an ex ‚Äî and exposes red flags, gaslighting, emotional manipulation, and mixed signals in seconds.

You paste. It reads. You get the truth.

## üß† What It Does

GhostRead-AI uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to:

- Detect emotional manipulation, deflection, or gaslighting  
- Highlight red flags and unhealthy communication patterns  
- Assign a relationship health rating (0‚Äì100)  
- Return a sarcastic but honest emotional breakdown

It's like therapy ‚Äî if your therapist had zero filter.
